# OCP_PREP
Code I used to prepare for Oracle Certified Professional

I used intelli J for this code

How to run the project?
1. After downloading the project, run mvn clean install to build the project
2. I have splited topics into packages
3. I made sure that I have commented the code and I tried to make it as readable as possible, except the main because that's where I'm        testing everything (So it look a bit messy)

I coded this using Oracle-Certified-Professional-Java-SE-8-Programmer-Exam-1Z0-809 study guide, so much of this code is form there
